# Tech of Blogs

[This is the repository for this challenge](https://github.com/lonHeligas/tech-of-blogs)

## Challenges I encountered

I should note that this app is currently incomplete, as the following things are missing:
Login/logout/sign up
password hashing
viewing comments on blogs
posting blogs
posting comments

Obviously I had a lot of challenges that I couldn't overcome in the time allotted (even with the extra day). This was an incredibly difficult assignment but I will be re-submitting it once I have everything completed.

## Your Task

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
